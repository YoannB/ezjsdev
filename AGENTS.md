## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# AGENTS.md — router for autonomous coding agents

Axons = Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) + React 19 + TS boilerplate for SEO AI apps;
Material UI 9 isolated behind a neutral API; `next-intl` 4; OpenRouter via one unified
Route Handler; Vitest + Playwright + Storybook 10; Node 24; Netlify (OpenNext adapter).
Site identity (`SITE_NAME`, nav, own routes/copy) lives in `site/` (`site/config.ts`, re-exported by
`constants/site.ts`) — a derived site edits only `site/`.

**This file is the ONLY always-loaded instruction. Do NOT preload `docs/*`.** Before
editing, open the ONE doc matching your task from the index below; cross-refs are
`file → heading name` (no section numbers). Model-facing files (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/**`,
`capabilities/**`) are written in ENGLISH and must never be localized.

## Index — load on demand

## Never do (un-enforced, catastrophic — the rest lives in the docs)

- Never expose `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, raw provider errors, prompts, or generated code to
  the client; the key is server-only (`lib/env-server.ts`).
- Never import `@mui/*` outside `components/ui/material/`, nor leak `sx`/`classes`/
  `slotProps`/`MuiTheme` through the neutral API (ESLint guards the import, not the leak).
- Never put synchronous `setState` in a `useEffect` body to mirror props/state.
- Never destructively remove a React-owned DOM node (`el.remove()`); hide via CSS class.
- Never localize `AGENTS.md`, `docs/**`, or `capabilities/**`.
- Never preload every doc; that recreates the novel this split removes.

## Definition of done (run before claiming success)

```powershell
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm run test && npm run build && npm run test:e2e && npm run storybook:build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs this same sequence on pull requests to `main`; keep both
in sync when a step changes.

Formatting is Prettier (`.prettierrc`: 4-space indent, 120 columns, LF). Run `npm run format`
before claiming success; never hand-format against it.

Plus `npm audit` (report severity / package / fix / impact; never claim "zero
vulnerabilities" from direct-dependency versions alone). Keep `package-lock.json`
committed; CI/Netlify use `npm ci`. Verify the OpenRouter model id at deploy time. A
command that starts without an obvious error is NOT a passing test — see the _Verification
philosophy_ heading in `docs/testing.md`.
